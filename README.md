## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

This tutorial builds on the Spatial Timer app to demonstrate how AI + MCP tools can speed up development. You’ll learn how to:

- 🤖 Connect an **AI assistant** (Gemini CLI or Android Studio AI) to the MCP server  
- 🐞 **Debug crashes** in natural language using live Logcat logs  
- 🎨 **Search and swap 3D assets** from Meta’s asset library on the fly  
- 🧪 **Capture screenshots, stream logs**, and automate ADB tasks via AI  

By the end, you’ll be working faster, shipping smarter, and spending more time coding instead of context-switching.
